It all started when Munawwar wore her yellow sweater and blue jeans for the first time at the Dries Lab. That very day set a great plan into motion, it was to be executed the day of Halloween. Everyone on site at the Dries & Ko Labs dressed up as their assigned characters from Arthur. Never fear, a two hour long photoshoot captured the fun and excitement that day.
